# Technology Graph

## An experiment to identify relationships between technologies.



### Objective
- Index all publically disclosed technologies.
- Indicate relationships between them, such as dependencies or enablers
- Create a comprehensive knowledge graph of the [technium](https://kk.org/thetechnium/the-seventh-kin/).
- Provide a standardized framework around which anyone can analyze the *technologial ecosystem*.
- Help non-experts undertand the *nature* of technology and its fundamental interconnectedness.
- Publish research findings on [GitHub](https://github.com/mz-000/TG).

---

### Instructions
- Navigate the research by loading this repository locally in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).
- Either [download the Vault](https://github.com/mz-000/TG/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) as a [[ZIP File]] or install a GitHub client on your [[Computer]].
- After installation, start here: [[Control of Fire]] 🔥

### Collaboration
- Feel free to create (*push*) new Technologies entries to the main branch.
- Also consider adding \[[ Links \]] between existing Technologies.
- For all new Entires, please indicate at least one Relationship and Source.

---

### ToDo
- [ ] Apply taxonomy (Tags) to all entries.
- [ ] Add sources to all entries.
- [ ] Create taxonomy for Relationships (currently indicating dependencies and enabling technologies).
- [ ] Reach consensus/definition about what is meant by *technology*.
- [ ] Unambigously define how this graph is different from Wikipedia.
- [ ] Validate 1 Domain with subject-area expert to approve approach.
- [ ] Determine long-term solution for funding & maintaining research.
