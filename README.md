# Technology Graph

## An experiment to identify relationships between technologies.



### Objective
- Index all publically disclosed technologies.
- Indicate relationships between them, such as dependencies or enablers.
- Create a comprehensive knowledge graph of the [technium](https://kk.org/thetechnium/the-seventh-kin/).
- Provide a standardized framework around which anyone can analyze the *technologial ecosystem*.
- Help non-experts undertand the *nature* of technology and its fundamental interconnectedness.
- Publish research findings on [GitHub](https://github.com/mz-000/TG).

---

### Instructions
- Navigate the research by loading this repository locally in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).
- Either [download the Vault](https://github.com/mz-000/TG/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) as a [[ZIP File]] or install a GitHub client on your [[Computer]].

- [ ] Create taxonomy for Relationships (currently indicating dependencies and enabling technologies).
- [ ] Reach consensus/definition about what is meant by *technology*.
- [ ] Unambigously define how this graph is different from Wikipedia.
- [ ] Validate 1 Domain with subject-area expert to approve approach.
- [ ] Figure out how to fund & maintain the research long term.
